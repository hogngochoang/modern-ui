## API Reference

```tsx
function useClickAway(
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement | null>,
  handler: (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => void
): void
```

### Inputs

- `ref`: A React ref object pointing to the DOM element to track clicks outside of
- `handler`: The callback function that will be triggered when a click outside the referenced element is detected

### Output

- The hook doesn't return any value (void)

### Behavior

- When a click (`mousedown`) or touch event (`touchstart`) occurs outside the referenced element, the handler is called with the original event
- The hook automatically manages event listeners (adding on mount and cleaning up on unmount)
- Touch events are supported for mobile compatibility
