# Getting Started with Modern UI

Modern UI is a powerful component library that makes it easy to build beautiful, responsive user interfaces for your web applications. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up Modern UI in your Next.js project.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Modern UI in your Next.js project:

### 1. Create a Next.js Project

If you don't have a Next.js project yet, create one with the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --tailwind --app --use-npm --skip-install
cd my-app
npm i
```

### 2. Initialize Modern UI

Run the initialization command to set up Modern UI in your project:

```bash
npx @modern-kit/ui init
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal to complete the setup.

### 3. Add Components

You can add specific components to your project using the add command:

```bash
npx @modern-kit/ui add button
```

## Using Components

Now you can start using Modern UI components in your project. Here's an example of how to use the Button component:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to My App</h1>
      <Button variant="primary">Get Started</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
