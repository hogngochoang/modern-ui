# modern-ui.json

The `modern-ui.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

<div className="bg-muted/10 border rounded-lg px-4 py-3 [&>p]:!mb-0 [&>p]:!text-[13px] [&>p]:!leading-5 mb-4">
    Note: The `modern-ui.json` file is optional and only required if <b>you're using the CLI</b> to add components to your project. If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this file.
</div>

You can create a `modern-ui.json` file in your project by running the following command:

<InitInstallation className="mb-4" />

See the [CLI](/docs/cli) section for more information.
